- 👋 Hi, I’m @bahree. These days I am working at **Microsoft** as part of Core AI **Azure AI Platform** engineering team building a bunch of #AI things (especially LLM's, SLM's and things related these days) - Azure #OpenAI, #ChatGPT, etc.
- 👀 I’m interested in things about tech, code, compilers, security, and #AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little more about AI, platforms, and system design; it seems the more I learn, the less I know. 🙄
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything specific; maybe if you can get a WPF app run well on Windows with a WebView2, so we can get the Tesla OAuth work, then we can chat. 🙃
