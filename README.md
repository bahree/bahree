- 👋 Hi, I’m @bahree. These days I am working at @Microsoft as part of the Azure AI Platform engineering team building a bunch of stuff.
- 👀 I’m interested in things about tech, code, compilers, security, and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little more about AI, platforms, and system design; it seems the more I learn, the less I know.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything specific; maybe if you can get a WPF app run well on Windows with a WebView2, so we can get the Tesla OAuth work, then we can chat.
- 📫 If you need to get a hold me of, tweet me @bahree🐥
- 📝 You can try and get to me via my blog https://blog.desigeek.com/
- 🐘 Or if you prefer <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.online/@bahree">Mastodon</a> at https://mastodon.online/@bahree 🐘
